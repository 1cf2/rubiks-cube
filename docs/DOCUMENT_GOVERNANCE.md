# Document Governance Framework

## Overview

This document establishes the governance framework for maintaining, reviewing, and updating all project documentation. It ensures documentation remains accurate, current, and valuable for development teams and stakeholders.

## Document Review Workflows

### 1. Review Triggers

Documentation reviews are triggered by the following events:

#### Automatic Triggers
- **Code Changes**: Any PR affecting documented components
- **Feature Completion**: When stories/epics are marked complete
- **Architecture Changes**: Modifications to system design
- **API Changes**: Updates to public interfaces
- **Deployment Changes**: Infrastructure or deployment process updates

#### Scheduled Triggers
- **Quarterly Reviews**: Comprehensive documentation audit
- **Release Reviews**: Before major version releases
- **Annual Reviews**: Strategic documentation planning

#### Manual Triggers
- **Stakeholder Request**: When documentation gaps are identified
- **Developer Feedback**: When docs are reported as outdated
- **New Team Members**: When onboarding reveals doc issues

**Legend**: R = Responsible, A = Accountable, C = Consulted, I = Informed

### 2. Update Trigger Automation

#### Git Hook Integration

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/post-merge
# Documentation update trigger

# Check if documented files were changed
CHANGED_FILES=$(git diff --name-only HEAD~1 HEAD)

# Define patterns that trigger doc updates
PATTERNS=(
    "packages/*/src/"
    "packages/*/package.json"
    "docs/architecture/"
    "README.md"
    "CLAUDE.md"
)

# Check each pattern
for pattern in "${PATTERNS[@]}"; do
    if echo "$CHANGED_FILES" | grep -q "$pattern"; then
        echo "Documentation update may be needed for changes in: $pattern"
        # Create GitHub issue or send notification
        curl -X POST \
            -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            -d "{
                \"title\": \"Documentation Update Required\",
                \"body\": \"Changes detected in $pattern may require documentation updates.\",
                \"labels\": [\"documentation\", \"maintenance\"]
            }" \
            "https://api.github.com/repos/$REPO/issues"
    fi
done
```

#### GitHub Actions Workflow

```yaml
# .github/workflows/doc-maintenance.yml
name: Documentation Maintenance

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 9 * * MON'  # Every Monday at 9 AM
  push:
    paths:
      - 'packages/*/src/**'
      - 'docs/**'
      - 'README.md'
      - 'CLAUDE.md'

jobs:
  check-documentation:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Check for outdated documentation
        run: |
          # Check for files older than 30 days
          find docs/ -name "*.md" -mtime +30 -exec echo "Potentially outdated: {}" \;
          
      - name: Validate links
        run: |
          # Install and run link checker
          npm install -g markdown-link-check
          find . -name "*.md" -exec markdown-link-check {} \;
          
      - name: Create maintenance issue
        if: failure()
        uses: actions/github-script@v6
        with:
          script: |
            github.rest.issues.create({
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              title: 'Weekly Documentation Maintenance Required',
              body: 'Automated checks found documentation issues that need attention.',
              labels: ['documentation', 'maintenance', 'automated']
            });
```

### 3. Notification System

#### Slack Integration

```bash
# Send documentation alerts to Slack
send_doc_alert() {
    local message="$1"
    local channel="#documentation"
    local webhook_url="$SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL"
    
    curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' \
        --data "{\"channel\":\"$channel\",\"text\":\"📚 Documentation Alert: $message\"}" \
        "$webhook_url"
}

# Usage examples
send_doc_alert "API documentation needs update after v2.1.0 release"
send_doc_alert "Architecture document is 60 days old - review recommended"
```

## Document Ownership and Lifecycle

### 1. Document Ownership Registry

```markdown
# Document Ownership Registry

| Document | Primary Owner | Secondary Owner | Subject Matter Expert | Review Frequency |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|----------------------|------------------|
| README.md | Tech Lead | Product Owner | Architect | Monthly |
| docs/architecture/ | Architect | Senior Dev | Tech Lead | Quarterly |
| docs/api/ | Backend Lead | API Developer | Tech Lead | Per Release |
| docs/LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md | DevOps | Senior Dev | Tech Lead | Monthly |
| docs/PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION.md | Performance Engineer | Senior Dev | Architect | Quarterly |
| packages/*/docs/API.md | Package Maintainer | Tech Lead | Domain Expert | Per Feature |
```

### 2. Document Lifecycle States

#### State Definitions
- **Draft**: Initial creation, not yet reviewed
- **Under Review**: Currently being reviewed
- **Active**: Approved and current
- **Update Required**: Needs updates but still usable
- **Deprecated**: No longer maintained, replacement exists
- **Archived**: Historical reference only

#### State Transitions
