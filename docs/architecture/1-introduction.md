# 1. Introduction

## Project Overview
This document defines the technical architecture for an HTML 3D Rubik's Cube Game that delivers console-quality 3D experiences in web browsers. The application prioritizes 60fps performance, intuitive gesture controls, and educational accessibility while maintaining cross-platform compatibility from desktop to mobile devices.

## Key Performance Requirements
- **60fps rendering** across all target devices
- **<2 second load time** for initial 3D scene
- **<16ms touch response** for gesture recognition
- **<100MB memory consumption** during normal operation
- **Cross-browser WebGL compatibility** with graceful degradation

## Architectural Approach
Performance-first monorepo architecture leveraging Three.js optimization, React component encapsulation, and TypeScript type safety for mathematical 3D operations and cube state management.
