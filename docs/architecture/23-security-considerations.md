- API rate limiting per session/IP
- Input validation for all cube operations
- Secure session management without personal data
- COPPA compliance for educational users

## Infrastructure Security
- HTTPS enforcement across all environments
- Container security scanning in CI/CD
- Minimal attack surface with single-purpose containers
- Regular dependency vulnerability scanning
