# 24. Scalability Considerations

## Horizontal Scaling Strategy
- Stateless backend design for easy scaling
- CDN integration for global asset delivery
- Database read replicas for analytics queries
- Redis cluster for session data distribution

## Performance Scaling
- Automatic LOD adjustment based on load
- Progressive asset loading for faster initial render
- Service worker caching for repeat visits
- Compression and minification for all assets

## Feature Scaling
- Modular architecture for new puzzle types
- Plugin system for educational content
- API versioning for backward compatibility
- Feature flags for gradual rollouts

This comprehensive technical architecture provides the foundation for building a high-performance, scalable 3D Rubik's Cube application that meets all PRD requirements while supporting the five-epic development sequence. The architecture prioritizes 60fps performance, cross-browser compatibility, and educational accessibility while maintaining clean, maintainable code structure.
