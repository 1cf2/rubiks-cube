## Recommendations

**OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENTS:**
1. Add specific device performance benchmarks for Three.js optimization targets
2. Include fallback strategy details for WebGL-restricted environments
3. Expand technical risk mitigation strategies for identified challenges

## Final Decision

**âœ… READY FOR ARCHITECT**

The PRD and epics are comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for architectural design. The minor technical documentation gaps identified are enhancements rather than blockers and can be addressed during architecture phase collaboration.
