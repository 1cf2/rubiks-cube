# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
Based on your Project Brief, here are the desired outcomes this PRD will deliver if successful:

• Create an engaging, high-performance browser-based 3D Rubik's Cube that maintains 60fps across devices
• Deliver intuitive mouse/touch controls that feel natural and eliminate user frustration with existing digital implementations  
• Provide progressive learning assistance that helps users master cube-solving techniques
• Achieve cross-platform excellence with responsive design from desktop to mobile without performance compromise
• Establish foundation for educational market penetration with spatial reasoning and problem-solving curriculum integration
• Build sustainable user engagement with 10,000+ monthly active users and 8+ minute average sessions
• Position as definitive digital Rubik's Cube solution that becomes go-to for both casual enjoyment and serious practice

## Background Context

The digital puzzle gaming market suffers from a critical gap in quality 3D Rubik's Cube implementations. Current web-based solutions frustrate users with poor 3D visualization, clunky controls, and performance issues that fail to replicate the tactile experience of physical cubes. This creates significant barriers for puzzle enthusiasts who want immediate access to cube practice and educational institutions seeking engaging tools for spatial reasoning instruction.

Modern WebGL capabilities and JavaScript frameworks now enable console-quality 3D experiences that weren't available when most existing solutions were built. By focusing on user experience rather than just puzzle functionality, this project addresses the core frustrations driving user abandonment in the digital cubing space. The solution leverages Three.js optimization for performance-first rendering while implementing intelligent gesture recognition that interprets user intent without frustrating mode switching, creating the foundation for both entertainment and educational market success.
