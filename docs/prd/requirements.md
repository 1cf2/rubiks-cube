# Requirements

## Functional Requirements

**FR1:** The system shall render a realistic 3D Rubik's Cube using Three.js/WebGL with accurate colors, proportions, and visual feedback that maintains 60fps performance across desktop and mobile browsers.

**FR2:** The system shall provide intuitive mouse drag and touch gesture controls that intelligently distinguish between face rotations and cube orientation changes without requiring mode switching.

**FR3:** The system shall implement a scrambling system that generates solvable cube states with configurable difficulty levels (beginner: 10 moves, intermediate: 20 moves, advanced: 30+ moves).

**FR4:** The system shall display real-time move count, timer functionality, and basic statistics (current session, personal best) with local storage persistence across browser sessions.

**FR5:** The system shall provide a step-by-step interactive tutorial covering basic controls, cube notation, and fundamental solving concepts with progressive disclosure of complexity.

**FR6:** The system shall implement responsive design ensuring consistent experience across desktop (1024px+), tablet (768-1023px), and mobile (320-767px) with touch-optimized controls.

**FR7:** The system shall provide visual indicators showing selected faces and rotation direction during user interactions to provide clear feedback.

**FR8:** The system shall detect and validate cube state changes to ensure moves are legal and cube remains in a solvable state.

**FR9:** The system shall allow users to reset cube to solved state and restart timer/move counter at any time.

**FR10:** The system shall provide basic hint system indicating next optimal move or highlighting relevant cube pieces for beginners.

## Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1:** The system shall load initial 3D cube scene within 2 seconds on modern browsers with broadband internet connection.

**NFR2:** The system shall maintain rendering performance of 60fps during cube rotations and animations on devices with dedicated GPU.

**NFR3:** The system shall support modern web browsers (Chrome 60+, Firefox 60+, Safari 12+, Edge 79+) with graceful degradation for older browsers.

**NFR4:** The system shall be responsive to touch inputs within 16ms to provide smooth gesture recognition on mobile devices.

**NFR5:** The system shall consume less than 100MB of device memory during normal operation to ensure compatibility with older devices.

**NFR6:** The system shall implement HTTPS enforcement and secure session management to protect user data and preferences.

**NFR7:** The system shall be accessible on school networks with potential WebGL restrictions through fallback rendering options.

**NFR8:** The system shall maintain 95%+ uptime through reliable hosting infrastructure and error handling.

**NFR9:** The system shall comply with COPPA requirements for educational users under 13 years of age.

**NFR10:** The system shall provide keyboard navigation alternatives for accessibility compliance with basic screen reader support.
