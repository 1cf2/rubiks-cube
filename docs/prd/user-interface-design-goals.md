# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
Create an immersive, intuitive 3D puzzle experience that feels as natural as manipulating a physical Rubik's Cube. The interface should be clean and unobtrusive, allowing the 3D cube to be the central focus while providing essential controls and feedback through subtle visual cues. Users should experience immediate understanding of how to interact with the cube without extensive instructions, supported by smooth animations and responsive feedback that builds confidence and engagement.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Direct Manipulation:** Mouse drag and touch gestures directly rotate cube faces and orientation with immediate visual feedback
- **Intelligent Gesture Recognition:** System automatically interprets user intent (face rotation vs. cube rotation) based on gesture context and starting position
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Tutorial and hint systems reveal complexity gradually, starting with basic controls and advancing to cube notation and solving strategies
- **Visual Feedback Loop:** Clear indicators for selected faces, rotation direction, and move validation provide continuous user guidance
- **Context-Aware Help:** On-demand assistance that adapts to current cube state and user progress level

## Core Screens and Views
- **Main Game View:** Full-screen 3D cube with minimal UI overlay showing timer, move counter, and essential controls
- **Tutorial Overlay:** Step-by-step interactive guidance system that overlays the main view with progressive instruction panels
- **Settings Panel:** Compact sliding panel for difficulty selection, visual preferences, and tutorial access
- **Statistics Dashboard:** Simple modal displaying session stats, personal bests, and progress tracking
- **Help/Reference View:** Quick access to cube notation guide, control reminders, and solving tips

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements with clear focus indicators
- High contrast mode option for visual accessibility 
- Screen reader support for move announcements and game state
- Alternative text descriptions for visual cube state indicators
- Reduced motion option for users sensitive to animations while maintaining core functionality
- Color accessibility with pattern or texture alternatives to color-only face identification

## Branding
Modern, clean aesthetic emphasizing the classic Rubik's Cube color scheme while feeling contemporary and digital-native. Interface elements use subtle gradients and shadows to complement the 3D cube rendering without competing for attention. Typography should be clear and readable across all device sizes, with color coding that supports rather than replaces the cube's visual language.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Optimized for desktop-first experience with mouse precision controls, then adapted for tablet and mobile with touch-optimized gesture recognition. Responsive breakpoints ensure consistent functionality from 320px mobile screens to 4K desktop displays, with performance scaling based on device capabilities and automatic quality adjustment for optimal frame rates.
