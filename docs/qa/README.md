## Quality Gates Directory

The `gates/` directory contains YAML files for individual story quality assessments:

```
gates/
├── 2.1-mouse-based-face-rotation-controls.yml
├── 2.2-touch-gesture-recognition-for-mobile.yml  
├── 2.3-cube-orientation-and-camera-controls.yml
└── 3.1-cube-state-management-and-logic-engine.yml
```

Each gate file follows the schema:
- **gate**: PASS/CONCERNS/FAIL/WAIVED
- **status_reason**: Detailed explanation of decision
- **top_issues**: Critical items requiring attention
- **reviewer**: QA reviewer identification
- **updated**: Last review timestamp

## Quality Standards

### Coverage Thresholds
- **Unit Tests**: 90%+ code coverage
- **Integration Tests**: 80%+ critical path coverage  
- **E2E Tests**: 100% user journey coverage
- **Performance Tests**: All critical operations benchmarked

### Performance Targets
- **Desktop**: 60fps sustained rendering
- **Mobile**: 30fps minimum with quality adaptation
- **Load Time**: <2 seconds initial application load
- **Memory**: <100MB during normal operation

### Browser Support Matrix
- **Tier 1**: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+
- **Tier 2**: Chrome 80+, Firefox 78+, Safari 13+  
- **Mobile**: iOS Safari 14+, Chrome Mobile 90+

### Accessibility Standards
- **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** compliance
- **Keyboard Navigation** full application access
- **Screen Reader** compatibility testing
- **Color Contrast** minimum 4.5:1 ratio

## Automation & CI/CD Integration

### Automated Testing
- Unit tests run on every commit
- Integration tests on pull request creation
- E2E tests on release candidates
- Performance regression tests weekly

### Quality Gate Automation
- Coverage threshold enforcement
- Performance benchmark validation
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Accessibility compliance checking

## Usage Guidelines

### For Developers
1. Review applicable checklists before feature completion
2. Ensure coverage thresholds are met for new code
3. Run performance benchmarks for 3D-related changes
4. Test across primary browser targets

### For QA Team
1. Use gate templates for consistent story evaluation
2. Update matrices after compatibility testing
3. Maintain benchmark baselines after optimization work
4. Document and track accessibility remediation

### For Product Team
1. Reference performance targets for feature scoping
2. Review compatibility matrix for browser support decisions  
3. Use accessibility checklist for inclusive design validation
4. Monitor quality gate trends for release readiness

## Continuous Improvement
