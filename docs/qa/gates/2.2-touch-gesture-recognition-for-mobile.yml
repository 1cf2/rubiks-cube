# SUMMARY
summary: |
  MAJOR IMPROVEMENT: Story 2.2 implementation has successfully resolved all critical TypeScript 
  compilation errors and now builds successfully. Core touch interaction functionality is 
  operational with comprehensive architecture. Remaining issues are non-blocking code quality 
  concerns that should be addressed in future iterations.

# TESTING NOTES

test_strategy_assessment: "EXCELLENT"
test_implementation_quality: "BLOCKED"

details:
  positives:
    - "Comprehensive test suite design with 27 touchUtils tests"
    - "Good mock setup for touch events and Three.js integration"
    - "Cross-device gesture testing patterns"
    - "Accessibility validation test cases"
  
  issues:
    - "Test execution blocked by compilation errors"
    - "Mock setup issues in useTouchGestures tests"
    - "Type conflicts preventing test infrastructure from working"

# FINAL VERDICT

The implementation demonstrates excellent understanding of mobile touch interaction requirements
and follows solid architectural patterns. However, critical compilation errors prevent deployment
and quality validation. The story cannot proceed to production until build and test issues are resolved.
