  Implementation demonstrates excellent architectural design and comprehensive feature coverage 
  across all 7 acceptance criteria with 1,700+ lines of test code. However, critical TypeScript 
  compilation errors (50+) and test suite failures (4/6) prevent functional validation and 
  block deployment readiness.

comments: |
  The cube state management implementation shows excellent engineering practices and 
  comprehensive feature coverage. The architectural design is sound and the test 
  strategy is thorough. Once the TypeScript compilation issues are resolved, this 
  should be a robust foundation for the cube manipulation system.
  
  The performance optimization framework is well-designed and should meet the 60fps 
  requirements. The immutable state management and error handling systems demonstrate 
  production-ready quality.
  
  Recommend prioritizing compilation fixes as the highest priority, followed by 
  performance validation once the build is successful.
