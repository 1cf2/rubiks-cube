### TypeScript Configuration Requirements  
[Source: architecture/17-coding-standards.md]
- Strict type safety for mathematical operations with Vector3D and Quaternion interfaces
- Immutable cube state operations with ReadonlyArray<FaceState>
- Performance-critical function annotations for 16ms execution time
- Error handling for 3D operations with CubeOperationResult<T> type
- Comprehensive CubeError enum for INVALID_MOVE, ANIMATION_IN_PROGRESS, WEBGL_CONTEXT_LOST, PERFORMANCE_DEGRADED

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md]
- **Unit Testing**: 90%+ coverage using Jest and Testing Library
- **Focus Areas**: Cube state management, move validation, 3D mathematics, component rendering, input handling
- **Three.js Testing**: Custom testing utilities for 3D rendering without WebGL dependency
- **Performance Testing**: Frame rate benchmarking, load time measurement, memory usage tracking
- **Testing Structure**: Each package requires dedicated tests/ directory with comprehensive coverage

### Project Structure Notes
All file paths and component locations align with the unified project structure defined in the architecture documents. The monorepo structure supports clear separation of concerns while enabling efficient cross-package dependencies.

## Testing
### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md]
- **Test File Location**: Each package must have a `tests/` directory containing unit and integration tests
- **Testing Frameworks**: Jest for unit testing, React Testing Library for component testing
- **Coverage Requirements**: Minimum 90% unit test coverage, 80% integration test coverage
- **Performance Testing**: Custom benchmarks for Three.js rendering performance
- **Testing Patterns**: 
  - Mock Three.js scenes for testing without WebGL
  - Test cube state management with immutable operations
  - Validate TypeScript types for 3D mathematics accuracy
  - Performance assertions for sub-16ms execution times
