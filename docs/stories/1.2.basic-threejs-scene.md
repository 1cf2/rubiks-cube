## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Building on the completed development environment setup from Story 1.1, this story leverages the established Three.js, TypeScript, and React infrastructure to create the first visual 3D cube rendering.

### Component Architecture Requirements
[Source: architecture/10-frontend-architecture.md]
**Three.js Component Structure**:
```
src/components/three/
├── ThreeScene.tsx       # Scene container with performance monitoring
├── CubeRenderer.tsx     # Optimized cube geometry and materials  
├── LightingSetup.tsx    # Performance-tuned lighting
└── CameraController.tsx # Basic camera setup for this story
```

**Component Integration Pattern**:
```typescript
<App>
  <ThreeScene>
    <CubeRenderer />
    <LightingSetup />
    <CameraController />
  </ThreeScene>
</App>
```

### Data Models and State Management
[Source: architecture/4-data-models.md]
**Core 3D Rendering State**:
```typescript
interface RenderState {
  scene: THREE.Scene;
  camera: THREE.PerspectiveCamera;
  renderer: THREE.WebGLRenderer;
  cubeGroup: THREE.Group;           # Container for 27 cube pieces
  animationState: AnimationState;
  performanceMetrics: PerformanceMetrics;
}

interface AnimationState {
  isAnimating: boolean;
  currentAnimation: CubeAnimation | null;
  queue: CubeAnimation[];
  frameRate: number;               # Target: 60fps desktop, 30fps mobile
}
```

**Cube State Representation**:
```typescript
interface CubeState {
  faces: FaceState[6];             # 6 faces of the cube
  moveHistory: Move[];
  isScrambled: boolean;            # Initially false for solved state
  isSolved: boolean;               # Initially true for solved state
  timestamp: number;
}

interface FaceState {
  face: CubeFace;                  # 'front'|'back'|'left'|'right'|'up'|'down'
  colors: CubeColor[9];            # 3x3 grid: white, red, blue, orange, green, yellow
  rotation: number;                # Current rotation in radians
}
```

### Performance Requirements and Optimization
[Source: architecture/22-performance-budget-and-targets.md]
**Performance Targets**:
- **Desktop Frame Rate**: 60fps with full quality rendering
- **Mobile Frame Rate**: 30fps with optimized materials
- **Load Time Budget**: Three.js bundle <500KB, total initial load <855KB
- **First Contentful Paint**: <1.5s desktop, <2.5s mobile
- **Memory Usage**: <100MB desktop, <75MB mobile

**Quality Settings by Device**:
- **High-end Desktop**: 60fps, Ultra quality, full features
- **Mid-range Desktop**: 60fps, High quality, reduced shadows  
- **High-end Mobile**: 30fps, Medium quality, simplified materials
- **Mid-range Mobile**: 30fps, Low quality, reduced geometry

### Three.js Configuration Specifications
[Source: architecture/10-frontend-architecture.md, architecture/17-coding-standards.md]
**Scene Setup**:
```typescript
// Scene initialization with performance monitoring
const scene = new THREE.Scene();
scene.background = new THREE.Color(0xf0f0f0);

// Camera configuration for optimal cube viewing
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(
  75,                              # Field of view
  window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight,  # Aspect ratio
  0.1,                            # Near plane
  1000                            # Far plane
);
camera.position.set(5, 5, 5);
camera.lookAt(0, 0, 0);

// Renderer with performance optimizations
const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({ 
  antialias: true,
  alpha: true,
  powerPreference: "high-performance"
});
renderer.setPixelRatio(Math.min(window.devicePixelRatio, 2));
renderer.shadowMap.enabled = false;     # Optimize for initial story
```

**Lighting System**:
```typescript
// Ambient light for overall illumination
const ambientLight = new THREE.AmbientLight(0x404040, 0.6);

// Directional light for face definition
const directionalLight = new THREE.DirectionalLight(0xffffff, 0.8);
directionalLight.position.set(10, 10, 5);
```

**Cube Geometry and Materials**:
```typescript
// Individual cube piece geometry
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(0.95, 0.95, 0.95);

// Standard Rubik's cube color materials
const materials = {
  white: new THREE.MeshLambertMaterial({ color: 0xffffff }),
  red: new THREE.MeshLambertMaterial({ color: 0xff0000 }),
  blue: new THREE.MeshLambertMaterial({ color: 0x0000ff }),
  orange: new THREE.MeshLambertMaterial({ color: 0xff8000 }),
  green: new THREE.MeshLambertMaterial({ color: 0x00ff00 }),
  yellow: new THREE.MeshLambertMaterial({ color: 0xffff00 })
};
```

### Core Workflow Integration
[Source: architecture/8-core-workflows.md]
**Scene Initialization Sequence**:
1. User loads application
2. Frontend initializes Three.js scene (target: <2s)
3. ThreeRenderer confirms scene ready
4. CubeEngine creates solved cube state
5. Basic rotation animation begins

**Performance Monitoring Flow**:
1. ThreeRenderer starts frame tracking on animation begin  
2. Performance monitor measures frame completion time
3. Quality adjustment if frame rate drops below target
4. Continuous monitoring during animation loop

### Error Handling and Fallbacks
[Source: architecture/17-coding-standards.md]
**Error Types and Recovery**:
```typescript
enum CubeError {
  WEBGL_CONTEXT_LOST = 'WEBGL_CONTEXT_LOST',
  PERFORMANCE_DEGRADED = 'PERFORMANCE_DEGRADED',
  INITIALIZATION_FAILED = 'INITIALIZATION_FAILED'
}

// Error boundary for Three.js components
class ThreeJSErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  // WebGL context loss recovery
  // Performance degradation handling  
  // Graceful fallback rendering
}
```

### Project Structure Notes
All Three.js components will be created in the `packages/web-app/src/components/three/` directory as established in the project structure. The cube rendering logic will be separated from the React components to enable future reuse in the `packages/three-renderer/` package.
