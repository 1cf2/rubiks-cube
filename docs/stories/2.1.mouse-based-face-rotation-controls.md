# Story 2.1: Mouse-Based Face Rotation Controls

## Status

**Done**

## Story

**As a** desktop user, **I want** to rotate cube faces by clicking and dragging with my mouse, **so
that** I can manipulate the puzzle intuitively without complex control schemes.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Mouse click detection on individual cube faces with accurate raycasting and face identification
2. Drag gesture recognition that determines rotation direction based on mouse movement relative to
   face orientation
3. Visual highlighting of selected face during hover and click interactions with clear color/opacity
   feedback
4. Smooth face rotation animation that follows mouse drag movement and snaps to 90-degree increments
5. Face rotation logic that correctly updates internal cube state and maintains cube integrity
6. Prevention of multiple simultaneous face rotations to avoid conflicting animations and state
   corruption
7. Mouse cursor changes to indicate interactive elements and valid rotation directions

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Building on the completed Three.js scene and deployment infrastructure from Epic 1, this story
introduces the first interactive elements that transform the static cube visualization into a
manipulable interface. The foundation work from Stories 1.1-1.3 provides the scene setup, rendering
pipeline, and performance monitoring that this interactive system will leverage.

### Data Models and State Management

[Source: architecture/4-data-models.md#core-business-entities]

**Move and Face State Structures**:

```typescript
interface Move {
  face: CubeFace;
  direction: RotationDirection; // 'clockwise' | 'counterclockwise' | 'double'
  timestamp: number;
  duration: number;
}

interface FaceState {
  face: CubeFace; // 'front' | 'back' | 'left' | 'right' | 'up' | 'down'
  colors: CubeColor[9]; // 3x3 grid of colors
  rotation: number; // Current rotation in radians
}

interface AnimationState {
  isAnimating: boolean;
  currentAnimation: CubeAnimation | null;
  queue: CubeAnimation[];
  frameRate: number;
}
```

### Component Architecture Requirements

[Source: architecture/10-frontend-architecture.md#react-component-organization]

**Three.js Integration Components for Mouse Controls**:

```typescript
// Component structure for mouse interaction system
components/
├── input/
│   ├── MouseControls.tsx     // Desktop mouse interactions (PRIMARY for this story)
│   ├── GestureHandler.tsx    // Unified gesture recognition
│   └── TouchControls.tsx     // Mobile touch optimizations (future story)
├── three/
│   ├── CubeRenderer.tsx      // Optimized cube geometry and materials
│   ├── CameraController.tsx  // Gesture-responsive camera controls
│   └── ThreeScene.tsx        // Scene container with performance monitoring
```

**Custom Hooks for Mouse Integration**: [Source:
architecture/10-frontend-architecture.md#state-management-architecture]

```typescript
const useCubeAnimations = () => {
  // Animation queue management
  // Performance-optimized transitions
  // Gesture-responsive controls
};

const useThreeScene = () => {
  // Scene initialization and cleanup
  // Performance monitoring integration
  // Automatic quality adjustment
};
```

### Three.js Raycasting Implementation

[Source: architecture/17-coding-standards.md#component-architecture-standards]

**Performance-Critical Mouse Detection**:

```typescript
interface PerformanceCritical {
  // Functions that must execute within 16ms for 60fps
  readonly executionTime: '16ms';
  readonly memoryAllocation: 'minimal';
}

// Error handling for 3D operations
type CubeOperationResult<T> = { success: true; data: T } | { success: false; error: CubeError };

enum CubeError {
  INVALID_MOVE = 'INVALID_MOVE',
  ANIMATION_IN_PROGRESS = 'ANIMATION_IN_PROGRESS',
  WEBGL_CONTEXT_LOST = 'WEBGL_CONTEXT_LOST',
  PERFORMANCE_DEGRADED = 'PERFORMANCE_DEGRADED',
}
```

### Animation and State Integration

[Source: architecture/8-core-workflows.md#critical-performance-flow-move-execution]

**Move Execution Performance Flow**:

```typescript
// Critical timing requirements for 60fps performance
Input -> GestureRecognizer (16ms target) -> CubeEngine -> ThreeRenderer
CubeEngine.updateState (1ms) -> ThreeRenderer.animate (16ms per frame)
```

### Responsive Design Considerations

[Source: architecture/10-frontend-architecture.md#responsive-design-strategy]

**Desktop-First Implementation**:

```typescript
desktop: {
  minWidth: 1024;
  cubeSize: 1.2;
  fullQuality: true; // Maximum visual fidelity
  precisionControls: true; // Mouse precision optimizations (PRIMARY FOCUS)
}
```

### Performance Requirements

[Source: architecture/22-performance-budget-and-targets.md#runtime-performance-budget]

**Critical Performance Targets**:

- Frame rate: 60fps during mouse interactions and animations
- Input latency: <16ms from mouse event to visual feedback
- Animation duration: 300ms per face rotation with smooth easing
- Memory allocation: Minimal during frequent mouse movements

### Testing Requirements

[Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md#threejs-specific-testing]

**Three.js Specific Testing for Mouse Controls**:

```typescript
class ThreeJSTestUtils {
  static simulateGesture(type: GestureType, parameters: GestureParameters): void {
    // Simulate mouse/touch interactions for testing
  }

  static validateCubeGeometry(cube: THREE.Group): boolean {
    // Verify cube structure and face positioning
  }

  static measureRenderPerformance(scene: THREE.Scene): PerformanceMetrics {
    // Benchmark rendering performance
  }
}

// Example test for mouse rotation
describe('Mouse Face Rotation', () => {
  test('should complete face rotation in 300ms', async () => {
    const scene = ThreeJSTestUtils.createMockScene();
    const mouseControls = new MouseControls(scene);

    const startTime = performance.now();
    await mouseControls.rotateFace('front', 'clockwise');
    const endTime = performance.now();

    expect(endTime - startTime).toBeLessThan(300);
    expect(mouseControls.isAnimating).toBe(false);
  });
});
```

### Project Structure Notes

All mouse interaction components will be created within the established monorepo structure. The
implementation leverages the Three.js scene setup from Story 1.2 and integrates with the CubeEngine
state management system. Component organization follows the established patterns with input handling
components in `packages/web-app/src/components/input/` and Three.js-specific logic in
`packages/three-renderer/src/interactions/`.
