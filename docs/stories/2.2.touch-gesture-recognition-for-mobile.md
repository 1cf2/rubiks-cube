# Story 2.2: Touch Gesture Recognition for Mobile

## Status

**Done**

## Story

**As a** mobile user, **I want** to manipulate the cube using touch gestures, **so that** I can play the game naturally on my phone or tablet.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Touch event handling that distinguishes between single finger face rotation and multi-finger cube orientation
2. Gesture recognition system that interprets swipe direction and velocity for face rotation commands

4. Visual feedback for touch interactions including touch point indicators and selected face highlighting
5. Touch gesture debouncing to prevent accidental multiple rotations from rapid finger movements

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Building on the mouse interaction foundation from Story 2.1, this story extends the input handling system to support mobile touch gestures. The existing raycasting system, AnimationStateManager, and FaceHighlighting components provide the foundation for touch interactions. Key lessons from 2.1 include the importance of preventing simultaneous animations, maintaining 60fps performance targets (adjusted to 30fps for mobile), and comprehensive error handling with the CubeOperationResult pattern.

### Data Models and State Management

[Source: architecture/4-data-models.md#core-business-entities]

**Touch Interaction State Structures**:

```typescript
interface TouchInteraction {
  id: number; // Touch identifier
  startPosition: Vector2;
  currentPosition: Vector2;
  timestamp: number;
  targetFace: CubeFace | null;
}

interface TouchGesture {
  type: 'swipe' | 'tap' | 'pinch' | 'rotate';
  direction: GestureDirection; // 'up' | 'down' | 'left' | 'right'
  velocity: number;
  touches: TouchInteraction[];
  confidence: number; // Gesture recognition confidence
}

interface MobileInputState {
  activeTouches: Map<number, TouchInteraction>;
  currentGesture: TouchGesture | null;
  isGestureInProgress: boolean;
  touchTargetSize: number; // Minimum 44px for accessibility
}
```

### Component Architecture Requirements

[Source: architecture/10-frontend-architecture.md#react-component-organization]

**Touch Controls Component Structure**:

```typescript
// Touch-specific components extending existing mouse architecture
components/
├── input/
│   ├── TouchControls.tsx        // Main mobile touch interaction component
│   ├── GestureRecognizer.tsx    // Cross-platform gesture recognition
│   ├── TouchTargetManager.tsx   // Accessibility-compliant touch targets
│   └── MobileInputHandler.tsx   // Mobile-specific input processing
├── three/
│   ├── TouchInteractionHandler.ts  // Three.js touch integration
│   └── MobileFaceHighlighting.ts   // Mobile-optimized visual feedback
```

**Custom Hooks for Touch Integration**: [Source: architecture/10-frontend-architecture.md#state-management-architecture]

```typescript
const useTouchGestures = (sensitivity: number = 1.0) => {
  // Touch event detection and gesture recognition
  // Multi-touch handling and conflict resolution
  // Mobile-optimized performance settings
};

const useMobilePerformance = () => {
  // 30fps target for mobile devices
  // Automatic quality adjustment based on device capabilities
  // Battery optimization considerations
};
```

### Touch Event Handling Implementation

[Source: architecture/17-coding-standards.md#component-architecture-standards]

**Mobile Touch Detection**:

```typescript
interface TouchPerformanceCritical {
  // Touch functions must execute within 32ms for mobile responsiveness
  readonly executionTime: '32ms';
  readonly memoryAllocation: 'minimal';
  readonly batteryOptimized: true;
}

// Touch gesture validation
type TouchOperationResult<T> = 
  | { success: true; data: T }
  | { success: false; error: TouchError };

enum TouchError {
  INVALID_GESTURE = 'INVALID_GESTURE',
  MULTI_TOUCH_CONFLICT = 'MULTI_TOUCH_CONFLICT',
  TOUCH_TARGET_TOO_SMALL = 'TOUCH_TARGET_TOO_SMALL',
  GESTURE_TIMEOUT = 'GESTURE_TIMEOUT',
}
```

### Mobile Performance Integration

[Source: architecture/8-core-workflows.md#critical-performance-flow-move-execution]

**Mobile Move Execution Performance Flow**:

```typescript
// Adjusted timing requirements for mobile devices
TouchInput -> GestureRecognizer (32ms target) -> CubeEngine -> ThreeRenderer
CubeEngine.updateState (2ms) -> ThreeRenderer.animate (33ms per frame for 30fps)
```

### Responsive Design Requirements

[Source: architecture/10-frontend-architecture.md#responsive-design-strategy]

**Mobile-Specific Configuration**:

```typescript
mobile: {
  maxWidth: 767;
  cubeSize: 0.8;              // Smaller cube for mobile screens
  touchTargetSize: 44;        // Accessibility-compliant touch targets (PRIMARY FOCUS)
  simplifiedShaders: true;    // Reduced visual complexity for performance
  frameRate: 30;              // Optimized for mobile GPU limitations
  inputLatency: 32;           // <32ms target vs <16ms for desktop
}
```

### Touch Target Accessibility

[Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md#accessibility-requirements]

**Touch Target Implementation**:

```typescript
interface AccessibleTouchTarget {
  minimumSize: 44; // px - WCAG AA compliance
  targetExpansion: 'invisible-overlay'; // Expand touch area beyond visual face
  visualFeedback: 'immediate'; // <32ms response to touch
  contrastRatio: 3; // Minimum for touch state indicators
}
```

### Performance Requirements

[Source: architecture/22-performance-budget-and-targets.md#runtime-performance-budget]

**Mobile Performance Targets**:

- Frame rate: 30fps during touch interactions and animations (vs 60fps desktop)
- Input latency: <32ms from touch event to visual feedback (vs <16ms desktop)
- Animation duration: 300ms per face rotation (same as desktop)
- Memory usage: <75MB during mobile operation (vs <100MB desktop)
- Touch target size: Minimum 44px for accessibility compliance

### Testing Requirements

[Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md#threejs-specific-testing]

**Mobile Touch Testing Strategy**:

```typescript
class MobileTouchTestUtils {
  static simulateTouchGesture(type: TouchGestureType, parameters: TouchParameters): void {
    // Simulate touch events for testing across devices
  }

  static validateTouchTargets(element: HTMLElement): AccessibilityResult {
    // Verify touch target size meets 44px minimum
  }

  static measureTouchPerformance(handler: TouchHandler): PerformanceMetrics {
    // Benchmark touch responsiveness and frame rate
  }
}

// Example test for touch rotation
describe('Touch Face Rotation', () => {
  test('should complete face rotation with touch gesture', async () => {
    const touchControls = new TouchControls(mockScene);
    
    const touchGesture = MobileTouchTestUtils.createSwipeGesture({
      direction: 'right',
      velocity: 2.0,
      targetFace: 'front'
    });
    
    const startTime = performance.now();
    await touchControls.handleTouchGesture(touchGesture);
    const endTime = performance.now();
    
    expect(endTime - startTime).toBeLessThan(300);
    expect(touchControls.isAnimating).toBe(false);
  });
  
  test('should meet accessibility touch target requirements', () => {
    const touchTargets = touchControls.getTouchTargets();
    touchTargets.forEach(target => {
      expect(target.width).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(44);
      expect(target.height).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(44);
    });
  });
});
```

### Project Structure Notes

All touch interaction components will be created within the established monorepo structure, extending the mouse interaction patterns from Story 2.1. The implementation leverages the Three.js scene setup and CubeEngine state management while adding mobile-specific optimizations. Component organization follows established patterns with touch-specific logic in `packages/web-app/src/components/input/` and Three.js integration in `packages/three-renderer/src/interactions/`. Mobile performance optimizations are critical for maintaining 30fps on mobile devices while ensuring touch targets meet accessibility standards.
