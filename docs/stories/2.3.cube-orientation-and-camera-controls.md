# Story 2.3: Cube Orientation and Camera Controls

## Status

**Approved**

## Story

**As a** user, **I want** to rotate and view the cube from different angles, **so that** I can see all faces and plan my solving strategy effectively.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Right-click or two-finger touch controls for rotating entire cube orientation without affecting face positions
2. Camera controls that maintain focus on cube center while allowing 360-degree viewing from all angles
3. Smooth camera animation with momentum and easing for natural movement feel
4. Zoom controls (mouse wheel, pinch) with appropriate limits to maintain cube visibility and performance
5. Auto-rotation feature that slowly rotates cube when idle to showcase 3D effect and maintain visual interest
6. Reset view button to return cube to default orientation for consistent user reference point
7. Camera state persistence so users return to their preferred viewing angle across sessions

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Building on the interactive foundation from Stories 2.1 and 2.2, this story adds crucial camera and view management capabilities that complement the face rotation controls. The existing raycasting system, AnimationStateManager, and input handling components provide the foundation for camera interactions. Key lessons from previous stories include the importance of preventing simultaneous animations, maintaining performance targets (60fps desktop, 30fps mobile), and comprehensive error handling with the CubeOperationResult pattern. The touch gesture recognition system from Story 2.2 can be extended to support two-finger camera controls.

### Data Models and State Management

[Source: architecture/4-data-models.md#core-business-entities]

**Camera State Structures**:

```typescript
interface CameraState {
  position: Vector3D;
  rotation: Quaternion;
  zoom: number;
  target: Vector3D; // Always cube center (0,0,0)
  isAnimating: boolean;
  autoRotationEnabled: boolean;
}

interface CameraAnimation {
  type: 'orbit' | 'zoom' | 'reset' | 'auto-rotate';
  startState: CameraState;
  targetState: CameraState;
  duration: number;
  easing: EasingFunction;
  onComplete?: () => void;
}

interface ViewPreferences {
  defaultCameraPosition: Vector3D;
  autoRotationSpeed: number;
  autoRotationTimeout: number; // ms before auto-rotation starts
  zoomSensitivity: number;
  orbitSensitivity: number;
  persistCameraState: boolean;
}
```

```

### Auto-Rotation Implementation

[Source: architecture/22-performance-budget-and-targets.md#runtime-performance-budget]

**Auto-Rotation Configuration**:

```typescript
interface AutoRotationConfig {
  idleTimeout: 5000;              // ms before auto-rotation starts
  rotationSpeed: 0.5;             // radians per second
  rotationAxis: Vector3D;         // Default: (0, 1, 0) for Y-axis rotation
  pauseOnHover: true;             // Pause rotation when cursor over cube
  interruptOnInput: true;         // Stop rotation on any user input
  resumeDelay: 2000;              // ms before auto-rotation can resume

**Camera Control Testing Strategy**:

```typescript
class CameraTestUtils {
  static createMockCamera(): THREE.PerspectiveCamera {
    // Lightweight camera setup for testing
  }

  static simulateCameraGesture(type: CameraGestureType, parameters: CameraParameters): void {
    // Simulate camera input for testing
  }

  static validateCameraConstraints(camera: THREE.Camera): ConstraintValidation {
    // Verify camera stays within bounds and constraints
  }

  static measureCameraPerformance(controller: CameraController): PerformanceMetrics {
    // Benchmark camera responsiveness and animation performance
  }
}

// Example test for camera orbit
describe('Camera Orbit Controls', () => {
  test('should maintain cube center focus during orbit', async () => {
    const cameraController = new CameraController(mockScene, mockCamera);
    
    const orbitGesture = CameraTestUtils.createOrbitGesture({
      direction: 'horizontal',
      distance: Math.PI / 4, // 45 degrees
      speed: 1.0
    });
    
    const startTime = performance.now();
    await cameraController.handleOrbitGesture(orbitGesture);
    const endTime = performance.now();
    
    expect(endTime - startTime).toBeLessThan(300);
    expect(cameraController.camera.lookAt).toHaveBeenCalledWith(0, 0, 0);
    expect(cameraController.isAnimating).toBe(false);
  });
  
  test('should respect zoom limits', () => {
    const zoomLimits = { min: 0.5, max: 3.0 };
    const cameraController = new CameraController(mockScene, mockCamera, { zoomLimits });
    
    // Test zoom beyond limits
    expect(cameraController.zoom(5.0)).toEqual({
      success: false,
      error: CameraError.ZOOM_LIMIT_EXCEEDED
    });
    
    expect(cameraController.zoom(0.1)).toEqual({
      success: false,
      error: CameraError.ZOOM_LIMIT_EXCEEDED
    });
  });
});
```

### Project Structure Notes

All camera control components will be created within the established monorepo structure, extending the input handling patterns from Stories 2.1 and 2.2. The implementation leverages the Three.js scene setup while adding camera-specific functionality. Component organization follows established patterns with camera logic in `packages/three-renderer/src/cameras/` and React components in `packages/web-app/src/components/three/`. Camera state management integrates with existing preference systems while maintaining performance targets across devices.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-18

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**EXCELLENT**: The camera controls implementation demonstrates outstanding architecture and engineering quality. The code follows solid object-oriented principles with clean separation between input processing, camera management, and React integration. TypeScript compilation errors have been successfully resolved through targeted refactoring that improved code maintainability without compromising functionality.

### Refactoring Performed

**File**: `/packages/three-renderer/src/controls/CameraInputProcessor.ts`
- **Change**: Removed unused imports (CameraGestureParameters, CameraGestureType, Vector3D) and unused private variables (isProcessing, lastInputTime, dragStartPosition)
- **Why**: Eliminated TypeScript compilation warnings and improved code clarity
- **How**: Cleaned up interface imports and removed dead code that was intended for future features but not currently used

**File**: `/packages/three-renderer/src/controls/CameraInputProcessor.ts`
- **Change**: Fixed null safety issues in touch gesture handling with proper bounds checking
- **Why**: Prevent potential runtime errors when accessing array elements that might be undefined
- **How**: Added explicit null checks and early returns when touch positions are not available

**File**: `/packages/three-renderer/src/controls/CameraInputProcessor.ts`
- **Change**: Prefixed unused function parameters with underscore (_timestamp, _x, _y) following TypeScript conventions
- **Why**: Maintain function signatures for future extensibility while satisfying linter requirements
- **How**: Used TypeScript naming convention for intentionally unused parameters

**File**: `/packages/three-renderer/src/cameras/OrbitCameraManager.ts`
- **Change**: Removed unused scene parameter and prefixed with underscore in constructor
- **Why**: The scene parameter was provided for future features but not currently utilized
- **How**: Marked parameter as intentionally unused following TypeScript best practices
