## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Building on Stories 2.1-2.3, this story adds basic visual feedback to the existing interaction system. The mouse controls, touch gesture recognition, and camera controls provide the foundation. Key architectural elements from previous stories include the raycasting system for face detection, animation management to prevent conflicts, and performance targets of 60fps desktop/30fps mobile.

### Data Models and State Management

[Source: architecture/4-data-models.md#core-business-entities]

**Existing Interfaces to Extend:**

```typescript
interface Move {
  face: CubeFace;
  direction: RotationDirection; // 'clockwise' | 'counterclockwise' | 'double'
  timestamp: number;
  duration: number;
}

interface FaceState {
  face: CubeFace; // 'front' | 'back' | 'left' | 'right' | 'up' | 'down'
  colors: CubeColor[9]; // 3x3 grid of colors
  rotation: number; // Current rotation in radians
}
```

### Component Architecture Requirements

[Source: architecture/10-frontend-architecture.md#react-component-organization]

**Basic Visual Feedback Implementation:**
- Extend existing `components/three/` for 3D highlighting
- Add simple hover states to existing input components
- Integrate with existing `GestureHandler.tsx` and `MouseControls.tsx`
- Follow established patterns from completed camera control implementation

### File Locations and Structure

[Source: architecture/12-unified-project-structure.md#monorepo-organization]

**Simple Visual Feedback Files:**

```
packages/
├── web-app/src/
│   ├── components/three/FeedbackHighlights.tsx    # Basic face highlighting

├── three-renderer/src/
│   └── effects/BasicHighlighting.ts               # Three.js highlighting logic
```

### Performance Requirements

[Source: architecture/22-performance-budget-and-targets.md#runtime-performance-budget]

**Target Compliance:**
- Maintain 60fps desktop, 30fps mobile during visual feedback
- Keep highlighting effects under 5ms execution time
- Use existing animation patterns to prevent conflicts

### Project Structure Notes

Visual feedback components will extend the established interaction patterns from Stories 2.1-2.3. The implementation uses existing Three.js scene setup, raycasting system, and animation management while adding simple visual feedback. Component organization follows established patterns with basic highlighting logic integrated into existing `three/` components.
