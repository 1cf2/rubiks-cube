## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Building on Epic 2 completion, the interactive controls foundation is established with mouse/touch gesture recognition, visual feedback, and performance targets of 60fps desktop/30fps mobile. The raycasting system for face detection and animation management are available. This story creates the logical foundation that the existing visual interaction system will integrate with.

### Data Models and State Management

[Source: architecture/4-data-models.md#core-business-entities]

**Core State Interfaces to Implement:**

```typescript
interface CubeState {
  faces: FaceState[6];
  moveHistory: Move[];
  isScrambled: boolean;
  isSolved: boolean;
  timestamp: number;
}

interface FaceState {
  face: CubeFace; // 'front' | 'back' | 'left' | 'right' | 'up' | 'down'
  colors: CubeColor[9]; // 3x3 grid of colors
  rotation: number; // Current rotation in radians
}

interface Move {
  face: CubeFace;
  direction: RotationDirection; // 'clockwise' | 'counterclockwise' | 'double'
  timestamp: number;
  duration: number;
}
```

### Component Architecture Requirements

[Source: architecture/17-coding-standards.md#typescript-standards-for-3d-applications]

**Type Safety and Performance Patterns:**

```typescript
// Immutable cube state operations
interface CubeState {
  readonly faces: ReadonlyArray<FaceState>;
  readonly timestamp: number;
}

// Performance-critical function annotations
interface PerformanceCritical {
  readonly executionTime: '16ms';
  readonly memoryAllocation: 'minimal';
}

// Error handling for cube operations
type CubeOperationResult<T> = 
  | { success: true; data: T }
  | { success: false; error: CubeError };

enum CubeError {
  INVALID_MOVE = 'INVALID_MOVE',
  ANIMATION_IN_PROGRESS = 'ANIMATION_IN_PROGRESS',
  WEBGL_CONTEXT_LOST = 'WEBGL_CONTEXT_LOST',
  PERFORMANCE_DEGRADED = 'PERFORMANCE_DEGRADED',
}
```

### Backend Service Integration

[Source: architecture/11-backend-architecture.md#service-layer-architecture]

**Service Layer Integration:**

```typescript
class CubeGameService {
  constructor(
    private cubeEngine: CubeEngine,
    private statisticsService: StatisticsService,
    private sessionManager: SessionManager,
    private performanceTracker: PerformanceTracker
  ) {}

  async processMove(sessionId: string, move: Move): Promise<MoveResult> {
    // Move validation and execution
    // State persistence
    // Performance metrics collection
  }
}
```

### Performance Requirements

[Source: architecture/22-performance-budget-and-targets.md#runtime-performance-budget]

**Target Compliance:**
- State operations must execute within 16ms for 60fps maintenance
- Memory allocation minimal during state transitions
- Move validation under 2ms execution time
- State serialization under 5ms for save operations

### Project Structure Notes

The cube engine forms the logical foundation that integrates with the existing Three.js visual system from Epic 2. State management will be consumed by the visual feedback and interaction systems already implemented. Component organization follows the established monorepo structure with clear separation between logic engine and rendering components.

## QA Results

**QA Review Date**: 2025-08-19  
**Test Architect**: Quinn  
**Overall Gate Decision**: ⚠️ **CONCERNS**

### Requirements Traceability ✅ COMPLETE
- **Acceptance Criteria Coverage**: 7/7 implemented (100%)
- **Task Completion**: 24/24 subtasks completed
- **Feature Implementation**: All core functionality present
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suites for all major components

### Implementation Quality Assessment

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Excellent architectural design with proper separation of concerns
- ✅ Comprehensive feature coverage across all acceptance criteria  
- ✅ Immutable TypeScript patterns implemented correctly
- ✅ Performance optimization framework with memoization and object pooling
- ✅ Extensive error handling and validation systems
- ✅ 1,700+ lines of test code covering unit, performance, and edge cases

**Critical Issues Identified**:
- 🔴 **TypeScript Compilation Errors**: 50+ compilation failures preventing build
- 🔴 **Test Suite Failures**: 4 test suites failing due to compilation issues
- 🔴 **Import Resolution Issues**: Cross-package dependency problems
- 🔴 **Type Safety Violations**: Array-to-tuple conversions and undefined access

### Performance Requirements
- ✅ **16ms Execution Targets**: Performance tests implemented
- ✅ **Memory Management**: Object pooling and cleanup mechanisms present
- ⚠️ **Validation Blocked**: Cannot verify actual performance due to build failures

### Risk Assessment
- **HIGH RISK**: Compilation failures block deployment
- **MEDIUM RISK**: Runtime reliability concerns due to type safety issues
- **LOW RISK**: Minor documentation and error message improvements needed

### Gate Decision Rationale
While the implementation demonstrates excellent design and comprehensive feature coverage meeting all acceptance criteria, critical compilation errors prevent validation and deployment. The underlying architecture appears robust once build issues are resolved.

**Estimated Resolution Time**: 4-8 hours for compilation fixes

### Required Actions Before Production
1. **CRITICAL**: Fix TypeScript compilation errors in CubeState.ts, StateManager.ts, MoveValidator.ts
2. **CRITICAL**: Resolve import path issues for shared module dependencies  
3. **CRITICAL**: Ensure all test suites compile and execute successfully
4. **RECOMMENDED**: Validate 16ms performance targets once build is working
5. **RECOMMENDED**: Add test coverage reporting and achieve 90%+ coverage target

### Test Execution Summary
- **Passing**: 2 test suites (AnimationStateManager, placeholder)
- **Failing**: 4 test suites (compilation errors)
- **Coverage**: Cannot measure due to build failures
- **Performance**: Cannot validate due to execution blocks
