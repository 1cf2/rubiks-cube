# 1. UX Vision & Design Principles

## Core UX Vision
Create an immersive, tactile-feeling digital experience that rivals physical cube manipulation through:
- **Natural 3D Interaction**: Gestures feel like touching a real cube
- **Visual Clarity**: 3D cube dominates with minimal UI interference
- **Progressive Mastery**: Learning path from novice to expert
- **Universal Access**: Consistent experience across all devices and abilities

## Design Principles

**1. Direct Manipulation First**
- Every interaction should feel like touching the cube directly
- No mode switching or complex control schemes
- Immediate visual feedback for all actions

**2. Performance as User Experience**
- 60fps is non-negotiable for maintaining immersion
- Visual design decisions prioritize frame rate over aesthetics
- Progressive enhancement based on device capabilities

**3. Progressive Disclosure**
- Interface complexity grows with user expertise
- Advanced features hidden until contextually relevant
- Tutorial system adapts to user progress

**4. Inclusive Design**
- WCAG AA compliance from day one
- Multiple input methods for same actions
- Works across diverse devices and network conditions
