# 7. Accessibility Architecture

## WCAG AA Compliance Strategy

**Visual Accessibility**
- High contrast mode: 4.5:1 minimum ratio
- Color-blind support: Pattern/texture alternatives for cube faces
- Font sizing: Minimum 16px, scalable to 200%
- Focus indicators: 2px high-contrast outlines

**Motor Accessibility** 
- Large touch targets: Minimum 44x44px
- Keyboard navigation: Full app control via keyboard
- Voice commands: Basic solving commands
- Switch control: Support for assistive devices

**Cognitive Accessibility**
- Consistent navigation: Same interaction patterns throughout
- Clear language: Simple instructions, no jargon
- Progress indicators: Clear tutorial advancement
- Error prevention: Undo functionality, confirmation dialogs

## Screen Reader Support

**Cube State Announcements**
```javascript
// Pseudo-code for screen reader integration
class AccessibilityAnnouncer {
  announceMoveCompletion(face, direction, newState) {
    const message = `${face} face rotated ${direction}. 
                    Move ${this.moveCount}. 
                    ${this.describeCubeState(newState)}`;
    this.announce(message);
  }
  
  describeCubeState(state) {
    const solvedFaces = this.countSolvedFaces(state);
    return `${solvedFaces} of 6 faces completed`;
  }
}
```

**Keyboard Navigation Map**
- Tab: Cycle through interactive elements
- Space/Enter: Activate selected element
- Arrow keys: Rotate cube orientation
- F/B/L/R/U/D + Arrow: Specific face rotations
- Escape: Exit current mode/tutorial
