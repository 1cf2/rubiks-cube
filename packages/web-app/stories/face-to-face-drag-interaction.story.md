# Face-to-Face Drag Interaction Logic Implementation

## As a Rubik's Cube Player
I want the ability to rotate cube layers by dragging from one face to an adjacent face
So that I can perform intuitive and precise rotations using natural mouse/touch gestures that clearly indicate which layer rotates and in which direction

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Interaction Logic
1. **Face A Selection**
   - Given I press the mouse/touch on a cube face
   - When the drag begins
   - Then that face becomes the reference face (A) for determining rotation direction

2. **Face B Targeting**
   - Given I've selected face A and am dragging
   - When the cursor moves over an adjacent face
   - Then that face becomes the target face (B) for determining rotation direction
   - And face B must be different from face A
   - And face B must be spatially adjacent to face A (sharing an edge)

3. **Layer Determination**
   - Given faces A and B are both on the side of the same layer to be rotated
   - When the drag vector from A to B is established
   - Then the layer containing faces A and B determines which layer rotates

4. **Direction Determination**
   - Given drag vector from face A to face B
   - When the rotation calculation commences
   - Then the direction (clockwise vs. counter-clockwise) is determined by:
     - Right-hand rule: thumb points toward rotation axis, fingers curl in rotation direction
     - Face A to B vector projected orthogonally to determine rotation plane
     - Perpendicular direction established relative to cube center

5. **Rotation Gesture Validation**
   - Given faces A and B both exist and are adjacent
   - When determining layer rotation
   - Then faces A and B must share the same layer depth parallel to the determined rotation plane
   - And rotation axis must be perpendicular to both faces A and B

### User Experience Requirements
6. **Visual Feedback**
   - Given face A is selected during drag
   - When hovering over valid adjacent face B
   - Then provide clear visual indication (highlight/color change) of potential rotation
   - And show preview of rotation direction with ghost visualization

7. **Interaction Boundaries**
   - Given drag gesture is in progress
   - When diagonal or non-adjacent faces are hovered
   - Then provide no visual feedback
   - And prevent rotation initiation
   - And display subtle "invalid" cursor state

8. **Gesture Sensitivity**
   - Given face A is selected
   - When drag moves to face B threshold distance
   - Then initiate rotation calculation at 50% of face width distance
   - And provide haptic feedback on supported devices

### Error Handling
9. **Invalid Gesture Recovery**
   - Given drag gesture becomes ambiguous (non-adjacent faces)
   - When cursor moves away from valid adjacent faces
   - Then return to initial state
   - And clear all visual feedback
   - And allow user to restart gesture

10. **Edge Case Handling**
    - Given cube is in solved or partially solved state
    - When performing gesture on center slice
    - Then ensure rotation behaves identically to non-center slices

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Face adjacency detection accuracy (99%+)
- Right-hand rule rotation direction calculation
- Visual feedback response times (<16ms)
- Invalid gesture recovery mechanisms

### Integration Tests
- Complete face-to-face drag gesture flows
- Layer determination with multi-face contexts
- Performance monitoring and validation
- Error handling for edge cases

### Performance Tests
- 60fps gesture feedback rendering
- Memory usage during long interaction sessions
- Gesture recognition latency measurements

## Technical Constraints

### Performance Target Requirements
- Frame Rate: 60fps sustained during all interactions (critical)
- Hover Response: ‚â§16ms latency for visual feedback (critical)
- Memory Usage: <100MB allocated during interaction (important)
- CPU Usage: Minimal impact on cube rendering performance (important)

### Browser Compatibility
- Chrome 90+, Firefox 85+, Safari 14+ (primary)
- WebGL 2.0 preferred, 1.0 fallback
- Hardware acceleration required for optimal performance
- Touch events for mobile compatibility

### Cross-Platform Requirements
- Mouse/touch gesture patterns must work consistently
- Keyboard alternative controls for accessibility
- Responsive interaction handling for different screen sizes

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria implemented and tested
- [ ] Performance requirements met (60fps, ‚â§16ms hover response)
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility verified
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage (unit + integration)
- [ ] Documentation updated with implementation details
- [ ] Code reviewed and follows existing patterns
- [ ] Accessibility features implemented and tested

## Notes
This implementation builds upon the existing MouseInteractionHandler and VisualFeedbackManager infrastructure. The core innovation is the face adjacency detection system that enables natural cube manipulation patterns similar to physical Rubik's cube interactions.

The mathematical foundation uses the right-hand rule for vector rotation calculations, ensuring consistent and predictable rotation directions based on the drag vector between reference face (A) and target face (B).
