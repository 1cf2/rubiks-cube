# Technology Stack - Rubik's Cube Project

## Stack Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the technology choices made for the 3D Rubik's Cube application, including rationale, alternatives considered, and architectural implications.

## Frontend Technologies

### Core Framework: React 18
**Choice:** React 18.0.0  
**Rationale:**
- **Concurrent Features**: React 18's concurrent rendering enables smooth 60fps animations while maintaining UI responsiveness
- **Suspense Integration**: Perfect for lazy-loading heavy 3D assets and code splitting Three.js bundles
- **Hook Ecosystem**: Custom hooks (`useCubeInteraction`, `usePerformanceMonitoring`) provide clean state management
- **Developer Experience**: Excellent TypeScript integration and debugging tools

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Vue 3: Good performance but less mature 3D integration ecosystem
- Vanilla JS: Would require building React-like patterns for complex state management
- Angular: Overkill for this application scope, heavier bundle size

### 3D Engine: Three.js 0.160.1
**Choice:** Three.js with custom React integration  
**Rationale:**
- **WebGL Abstraction**: Handles cross-browser WebGL compatibility automatically
- **Performance**: Direct WebGL access for 60fps cube rotations
- **Math Library**: Comprehensive 3D math utilities (Vector3, Quaternion, Matrix4)
- **Memory Management**: Explicit control over GPU resource lifecycle
- **Community**: Largest 3D JavaScript ecosystem with extensive documentation

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Babylon.js: More feature-heavy, larger bundle size, less suited for simple cube geometry
- PlayCanvas: Game-focused, requires their editor workflow
- Custom WebGL: Would require months of development for basic 3D features

### State Management: Redux Toolkit + Custom Engine State
**Choice:** Hybrid approach - RTK for UI, custom immutable state for cube logic  
**Rationale:**
- **Separation of Concerns**: UI state (camera position, debug panels) vs. cube state (rotations, game logic)
- **Performance**: Cube state operations bypass React reconciliation for sub-16ms execution
- **Immutability**: Both systems enforce immutable updates for predictable behavior
- **DevTools**: Redux DevTools for UI debugging, custom tooling for cube state inspection

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Pure Redux: Would create performance bottlenecks for 60fps cube animations
- Context API: Insufficient for complex state relationships and performance requirements
- Zustand: Lighter but lacks the mature DevTools ecosystem needed for complex debugging

### Build System: Webpack 5
**Choice:** Webpack 5 with custom configuration  
**Rationale:**
- **Code Splitting**: Automatic Three.js bundle separation (large library isolation)
- **Module Federation**: Enables future micro-frontend architecture if needed
- **Asset Pipeline**: Optimized handling of 3D assets, textures, and shaders
- **Development Experience**: Hot module replacement with React Fast Refresh

**Configuration Highlights:**
```javascript
// Bundle splitting strategy
optimization: {
  splitChunks: {
    chunks: 'all',
    cacheGroups: {
      three: {
        test: /[\\/]node_modules[\\/](three)[\\/]/,
        name: 'three',
        chunks: 'all',
      },
      vendor: {
        test: /[\\/]node_modules[\\/]/,
        name: 'vendors',
        chunks: 'all',
      },
    },
  },
}
```

## Backend Technologies (Future-Ready)

### Runtime: Node.js with Express
**Choice:** Node.js 18+ with Express.js framework

- **JSON Support**: Native support for storing complex cube states and move history
- **Performance**: Excellent query optimization for leaderboards and analytics
- **Ecosystem**: Mature tooling for backup, monitoring, and scaling

## Language & Type System

### Primary Language: TypeScript 5.9.2
**Choice:** TypeScript with strict configuration  
**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "strict": true,
  "noImplicitAny": true,
  "strictNullChecks": true,
  "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,
  "exactOptionalPropertyTypes": true
}
```

**Rationale:**
- **3D Math Safety**: Strict typing prevents common mathematical errors in 3D operations
- **Refactoring Confidence**: Large codebase changes are safe with comprehensive type checking
- **Performance**: Zero runtime overhead while providing development-time safety
- **Tooling**: Excellent IDE support with intelligent autocomplete and refactoring

**Key Type Patterns:**
- Immutable interfaces for cube state
- Discriminated unions for error handling
- Generic types for performance-critical operations
- Branded types for unit safety (degrees vs radians)

## Development & Build Tools

### Package Management: npm + Lerna 8.2.3
**Choice:** Lerna for monorepo management with npm workspaces  
**Rationale:**
- **Code Sharing**: Clean imports between packages (`@rubiks-cube/cube-engine`)
- **Independent Versioning**: Packages can evolve at different rates
- **Build Orchestration**: Parallel builds with dependency graph awareness
- **Testing Coordination**: Unified test running across all packages

### Code Quality: ESLint + Prettier
**ESLint Configuration:**
```json
{
  "extends": [
    "@typescript-eslint/recommended", 
    "prettier",
    "plugin:react/recommended",
    "plugin:react-hooks/recommended"
  ],
  "rules": {
    "@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars": "error",
    "@typescript-eslint/explicit-function-return-type": "warn"
  }
}
```

**Prettier Configuration:**
```json
{
  "semi": true,
  "trailingComma": "es5",
  "singleQuote": true,
  "printWidth": 100
}
```

### Testing Framework: Jest + Testing Library

### Monitoring Stack (Production Ready)
```typescript
// Performance monitoring integration points
interface PerformanceMetrics {
  frameRate: number;
  memoryUsage: number;
  renderTime: number;
  interactionLatency: number;
}

// Monitoring implementation hooks
const usePerformanceMonitoring = (): PerformanceMetrics => {
  // Real-time performance tracking
  // Automatic quality adjustment triggers
  // Error reporting integration
};
```

## Package Architecture

### Monorepo Structure
```
packages/
├── shared/           # Common types and utilities
├── cube-engine/      # Pure cube logic (no dependencies)
├── three-renderer/   # 3D rendering (depends on Three.js)
├── web-app/          # React frontend (depends on all)
└── api-server/       # Backend services (future)
```

### Dependency Flow
```
web-app
├── three-renderer
│   └── shared
├── cube-engine
│   └── shared
└── api-server
    └── shared
```

This architecture ensures:
- **Clean Dependencies**: Lower-level packages never depend on higher-level ones
- **Testability**: Core cube logic has zero external dependencies
